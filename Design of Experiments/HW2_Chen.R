#### build a logistic regression

summary(glm.fit)

# model findings:
# distance to location is significant -> the far from the park the less likely people are to to go
# only location 2 has a positive coefficient
# experience 2 and 3 are almost equally strongly positive
# other 4 stands out as the best options
# price 1 and 2 has no significant difference, but 3 and 4 are negative

# the older people are the less likely they are attending
# income groups 25-50k and 74-100k are most certain to go
# gender makes no differences
